-------

Reliable Multisession Transaction Protocol

* Protocol to transmit data reliably in a lossy environment
* Purposed to replace TCP in RTOS, which was expensive at the time
* Extremely light-weight; **total 961 lines** including test code!
* Robust - 100% transmission even in the environment of 5% packet loss
